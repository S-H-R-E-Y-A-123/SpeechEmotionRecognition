# SpeechEmotionRecognition

Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is a process of identifying human emotions through audio signals. This project utilizes the RAVDESS dataset to train a CNN-based deep learning model for classifying emotions like: Neutral, Happy, Sad, Angry, Fearful, Disgusted, Surprised.
The model extracts audio features and converts them into spectrogram images, which are then used as input to a CNN for classification.
